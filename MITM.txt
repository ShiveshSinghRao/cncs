The IP address of the client machine used over LAN for this demo is: 192.168.1.44
And the Attacker IP is: 192.168.1.1
 Open terminal and ping the target machine to verify the IP address you are using and to add it
to your arp table
 Type arp in the terminal command line to see your arp table
 For security purposes, IP forwarding is by default disabled in modern Linux systems. For
temporarily enabling it, type : echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
 For ARP poisoning, the command syntax is: arpspoof -i interface -t target -r host
 Example: arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.44 -r 192.168.1.1

A basic setup is complete and victim network traffic will now pass through the attacker machine. To
listen to these packets, we will use Wireshark
 Open up a new terminal and type wireshark. Go to the interface which is capturing all the data
flow (here eth0) and start the capture.
 Filter out packets according to what you are looking for. For the purpose of this demo, the
user is logging in to a vulnerable website DVWA which uses HTTP instead of the secure
version HTTPS. Filter protocol as http and search for required data.

Right click on the packet and follow TCP stream to open up the data contained within. We can
clearly obtain the login credentials of the user, that is the username and password

MITM is one of the classic hacks and on a LAN connection, ARP spoofing is much preferred. Today
there have been various measures to prevent such an attack by use of HTTPS, use of VPN and,
strong WEP/WAP encryption on access points
